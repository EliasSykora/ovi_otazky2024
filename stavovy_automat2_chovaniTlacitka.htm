			<h1>Buttons as Finite Automata</h1>
			<p>
				You can think of standard pushbutton controls as finite automata. Each state corresponds to some knowledge about where the mouse is and whether it's up or down.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is a standard HTML button along with a visualization of the finite-state
		machine that controls its operation. Play around with the button and watch how
		the operations you perform translate into state transitions in the machine!
